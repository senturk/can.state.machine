# Can State Machine (CSM)

**Can State Machinew** is an architectural and programming approach focused on replacing traditional sequential logic with explicit state machine modeling — making complex behavior easier to understand, test, and evolve.

It's called *Can State Machine* not only as a nod to state-driven architecture, but also as a personal imprint: this philosophy originates from **Can** — and yes, *state can flow*.

## 🌱 Why Can State Machine?

In modern software systems, control flow is often hidden deep inside long function chains, async callbacks, and implicit branching logic. This makes code harder to maintain, test, and reason about over time.

**Can State Machine (CSM)** embraces a different idea:

> ✨ Treat all control logic as a **flow of explicit states** — where every transition is visible, named, and controlled.

This mindset is especially powerful in domains like:

- Complex UI/UX flows
- Business rule engines
- Long-running backend processes
- Reactive systems
- Async orchestration (e.g. workflows, jobs, handlers)

## 🧠 What is State Machine Modeling?

State machine modeling describes a system in terms of:

- A **set of states**
- A set of **events** or **conditions**
- A defined set of **transitions** between states
- (Optionally) side effects or actions triggered by transitions

This structure gives you **predictability** and **declarative control** — instead of spaghetti-like control flow logic.

## ✅ Benefits of CSF

| Benefit         | Why it matters                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Maintainability** | Every transition is named, controlled, and visual — no mystery logic buried in conditionals. |
| **Transparency**    | The logic is modeled *declaratively* — what happens is described, not encoded. |
| **Predictability**  | You always know what state you're in, and what can happen next. |
| **Testability**     | States and transitions can be tested in isolation, without simulating entire flows. |
